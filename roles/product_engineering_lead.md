Product Engineering Lead
========================

For context how this role relates to other Engineering roles, see [Roles Overview](overview.md)

*A PEL is a formal role that is added to an engineer’s normal responsibilities.  Becoming a PEL does not result in a change in title, and people can switch in and out of this role on different teams based on what is the best fit for the team and individual at that time.*

## Should have
* An explicit interest in Product Engineering
* Developing outward facing ‘features’ versus just technical improvements
* Developing features with a mind towards how they will be consumed by an end user and the overall user experience
* The ability to communicate well with people from all areas of the company, especially Product, Design, and Engineering
* The ability and desire to talk about Product & Engineering problems, roadblocks, and solutions in a way that makes sense to technical and non-technical people
* The ability to construct and communicate realistic timelines for product team output and motivate engineers to deliver against those timelines
* The ability to take a nebulous product requirement, talk to the right people, define it, split it up into tasks, and ultimately get it done quickly and efficiently
* The ability to balance goals between tech and product
* Stepped up to take leadership of a project, team, or domain when needed

## Is expected to
* Work with non-engineering leadership (e.g. General Manager or Product Managers) to articulate definition of the Product Domain, that is, the set of products and features that are built then maintained
* Manage an Architectural Domain supporting a Product Domain
* Coordinate support and maintenance of Product Domain in production
* Serve as the point person for the Architectural Domain
* Manage the growth/shrinkage and coordination of engineering Teams and Projects for a Product Domain, including recommendation of forming/merging Teams within the domain.
* As needed, assign, coordinate, and manage Team Leads and Project Leads.
* For groups without Team or Project Leads, it is expected that the PEL assumes these responsibilities.

* Coordinate with leads on other teams when cross-team work is necessary, or when a project might have cross-team implications
* Represent Engineering in high-level product discussions, updates, and meetings around the company
* Provide technical feedback, support, and evaluation for other engineers on team
* Have regularly scheduled 1-on-1 with other engineers on product team, if needed
