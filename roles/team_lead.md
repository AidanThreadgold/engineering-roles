Team Lead
========================

For context how this role relates to other Engineering roles, see [Roles Overview](overview.md)

*A Team Lead is a formal role that is added to an engineer’s normal responsibilities.  Becoming a Team does not result in a change in title, and people can switch in and out of this role on different teams based on what is the best fit for the team and individual at that time.*

## Should have
* An explicit interest in Product Engineering
* Developing outward facing ‘features’ versus just technical improvements
* Developing features with a mind towards how they will be consumed by an end user and the overall user experience
* The ability to communicate well with people from all areas of the company, especially Product, Design, and Engineering
* The ability and desire to talk about Product & Engineering problems, roadblocks, and solutions in a way that makes sense to technical and non-technical people
* The ability to construct and communicate realistic timelines for product team output and motivate engineers to deliver against those timelines
* The ability to take a nebulous product requirement, talk to the right people, define it, split it up into tasks, and ultimately get it done quickly and efficiently
* The ability to balance goals between tech and product
* Stepped up to take leadership of a project or team when needed

## Is expected to
* Coordinate sprint planning and retrospective with Product Manager
* Work with product manager for prioritizing, breaking down, estimating, and assigning tasks
* Enact improvements to product team’s engineering process as needed
* Have regularly scheduled 1-on-1 with other engineers on product team, if needed
* Remove roadblocks for other engineers on team, to allow them to work most effectively
* Keep engineers in the loop and provide background about product decisions/changes/motivations/constraints
* Keep Product/Design/Others in the loop and provide background about engineering decisions/changes/motivations/constraints
* Work with PMs and designers to coordinate kickoffs, brainstorming, and prototyping between designers and engineers to facilitate better collaboration and product development
* Work with PMs and designers to ensure that product and feature specifications are complete and accessible to the engineering team
* For a without Project Leads, it is expected that the Team Lead assumes these responsibilities.
* As needed, assign, coordinate, and manage Project Leads for individual projects.
